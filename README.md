# ProbabilityAndShapesGame
This repository contains my CS171 project. It is a Probability and Shapes game. This project was designed in Processing.
You will need processing installed locally in order to play. 
The game is very simple. Press 'Start' to begin and 6 shapes will be displayed across the bottom of the screen. The goal is to repeat the sequence shown to you using 
the shapes on the top of the screen, and then press 'Start' again when you are finished.
